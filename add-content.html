<!-- document-object is the representation of the entire web page. All web browsers implement the object, and can be used just by calling its name. -->

<!-- the document object methods and properties are called "members" of that object -->

<!-- if you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JS will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created. -->
